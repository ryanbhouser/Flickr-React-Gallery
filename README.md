# Flickr React Gallery
## About the Project
A client-side image gallery that uses the Flickr API to search for images.  Built with React.


## Setting Up the API
In order to use the API, you'll need to create a Flickr account and get your own API Key.  Create a config.js file in the root directory and use the following code with your API key:
```
const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
export default apiKey;
```
